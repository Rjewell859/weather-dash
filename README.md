## Description

This is a weather application which allows users to search a city name and displays the current weather and the weekly forecast for
that location. The temperature, wind, humidity and UV index is displayed for the current date. The following five days are displayed 
in the weekly forecast with their temperature, wind and humidity values. The application uses local storage to store previously searched
locations from other sessions in a history section. When the history links are clicked, the data is populated on the page the same as
if the location had been searched.

## Installation

Open the application with index.html with a live server, in default browser or use the deployed link.

### Usage

Type a location into the search bar, click on the search button and weather data will be provided.
